Baseline results
================

Results for the three baselines will be made available
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g0HyGeVzFrNt2pvNuu8L1voFFQY-0CwjTxGA3VXXNGI/edit?usp=sharing)
as they become available.

Using the baselines
===================

[`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
is recommended for a reproducible environment. Once you have conda installed,
create a new conda environment by running this:

``` {.bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The new environment is called "task1". Activate it by running this:

``` {.bash}
conda activate task1
```
